| [Guidewire](https://www.guidewire.com/) | At Guidewire, we built Sawchain to solve real pain points in our Kubernetes testing workflow. We've used it to transform test suites across our platform components—Helm charts, OAM (KubeVela) components, Crossplane compositions, and custom operators—with dramatic results.<br><br>**Test Quality**: Our test suites are dramatically simpler, more readable, and easier to maintain. Setup and cleanup with Sawchain is far more reliable than `kubectl apply` or Terratest approaches we used previously. Representing expectations in YAML instead of verbose Go struct definitions has cleaned up our tests significantly, while we retain the flexibility to use Kubernetes object structs where it makes sense—we're just no longer forced to.<br><br>**Seamless Integration**: Sawchain integrates with Gomega and the controller-runtime client interface, which we already use extensively, making adoption natural. The ergonomic helpers enabled us to converge on a common standard library, replacing unreliable test utilities that varied by project. This consolidated our assertions, eliminated race conditions, and fixed flaky tests.<br><br>**New Capabilities**: Sawchain unlocked new test types we couldn't easily write before—offline rendering tests and schema validation tests that accelerate local development of templating abstractions. We migrated some existing Chainsaw test suites to Ginkgo + Sawchain to integrate with our [Fern Platform](https://github.com/guidewire-oss/fern-platform) test reporting—a seamless migration since YAML templates remain unchanged. In other projects, we used Sawchain to simplify and expand existing Ginkgo suites.<br><br>**Ongoing Impact**: We continuously improve our code using the best available tools, and Sawchain has become one of the most impactful in our testing toolbox. We're actively expanding adoption across more projects to revamp existing tests and accelerate new test development. |
